# Welcome to my MDX page!

## A Detailed Exploration Welcome to my first blog post using MDX!

This is a simple example showcasing the basic structure. Here's some **bold** text and some _italicized_ text. You can also add links like this: [link text](https://www.example.com).

Let's explore some additional features!

**1. Syntax Highlighting:**

MDX supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages. This allows you to showcase code snippets with proper formatting and coloring, making them easier to read and understand. Here's an example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greet(name = "sam") {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John");
```

**Explanation:**

- We've added the `style` attribute to the image tag.
- Within the `style` attribute, we've defined `border-radius: 50px;`. This sets a circular border radius to the image. You can adjust the value (e.g., `10px` for a softer curve) to achieve your desired effect.

**2. Using a CSS Class (Optional):**

This approach involves creating a CSS class for styling and applying it to the image:

**a) Create a CSS class (assuming a CSS file named `styles.css`):**

```css
.rounded-image {
  border-radius: 50px; /* Adjust the value for desired radius */
}
```
